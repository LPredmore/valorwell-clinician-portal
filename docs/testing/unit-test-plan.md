# Calendar Component Unit Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the unit testing strategy for the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. Unit tests focus on testing individual functions, hooks, and components in isolation to ensure they work as expected.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking API requests
- **jest-dom**: For additional DOM testing utilities

## Test Organization

Unit tests are organized in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the code they test:

- `src/utils/__tests__/`: Tests for utility functions
- `src/hooks/__tests__/`: Tests for custom hooks
- `src/components/calendar/__tests__/`: Tests for calendar components

## Testing Approach

### 1. Utility Functions Testing

Utility functions in `src/utils/` will be tested with a focus on:

- Input validation
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Expected output for various inputs

#### Key Utilities to Test:

- `dateUtils.ts`: Date formatting, manipulation, and timezone conversion
- `cacheUtils.ts`: Caching mechanisms and LRU implementation
- `calendarErrorReporter.ts`: Error reporting functionality
- `cssOptimizer.ts`: CSS optimization utilities
- `timeZoneUtils.ts`: Timezone conversion and handling

### 2. Hooks Testing

Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` will be tested using the `@testing-library/react-hooks` package with a focus on:

- Initial state
- State updates
- Side effects
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations

#### Key Hooks to Test:

- `useCalendarState.tsx`: Calendar state management
- `useMonthViewData.tsx`: Month view data processing
- `useAppointments.tsx`: Appointment data fetching and processing
- `useCalendarErrorHandler.tsx`: Error handling for calendar components

### 3. Component Testing

Components in `src/components/calendar/` will be tested with a focus on:

- Rendering
- User interactions
- Props handling
- State management
- Error states
- Accessibility

#### Key Components to Test:

- `TimeSlot.tsx`: Time slot rendering and interactions
- `VirtualizedWeekView.tsx`: Virtualized week view rendering and performance
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Error boundary functionality
- `LazyLoad.tsx`: Lazy loading functionality

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Line Coverage**: 80%
- **Branch Coverage**: 75%
- **Function Coverage**: 85%
- **Statement Coverage**: 80%

## Mocking Strategy

- API calls will be mocked using Mock Service Worker
- Complex dependencies will be mocked using Jest mock functions
- Browser APIs will be mocked using Jest spies

## Test Data

- Test data will be stored in `__fixtures__` directories
- Mock data will be generated using factory functions
- Edge cases will be explicitly defined

## Continuous Integration

- Tests will run on every pull request
- Tests will run on every push to the main branch
- Coverage reports will be generated and tracked

## Maintenance

- Tests will be updated when the code changes
- Tests will be reviewed as part of the code review process
- Test failures will be addressed promptly

## Implementation Timeline

1. Set up testing infrastructure (Week 5, Day 1)
2. Implement utility function tests (Week 5, Days 1-2)
3. Implement hook tests (Week 5, Days 3-4)
4. Implement component tests (Week 5, Day 5 - Week 6, Day 1)
5. Review and improve test coverage (Week 6, Days 2-3)
