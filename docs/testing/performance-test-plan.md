# Calendar Component Performance Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. Performance tests focus on measuring and optimizing the speed, responsiveness, and resource usage of the calendar component.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Lighthouse**: For measuring web performance metrics
- **React Profiler**: For measuring component render performance
- **Performance API**: For measuring JavaScript performance
- **Chrome DevTools**: For profiling and analyzing performance

## Test Organization

Performance tests are organized in the following directories:

- `src/tests/performance/rendering.test.tsx`: Tests for rendering performance
- `src/tests/performance/dataLoading.test.tsx`: Tests for data loading performance
- `src/tests/performance/interaction.test.tsx`: Tests for interaction performance

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Rendering Performance Metrics

- **Initial Render Time**: Time to first render of the calendar component
- **Re-render Time**: Time to re-render after state changes
- **Component Mount Time**: Time to mount individual components
- **Frame Rate**: Frames per second during animations and interactions
- **Layout Shifts**: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) during rendering
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption during rendering

### 2. Data Loading Performance Metrics

- **Data Fetch Time**: Time to fetch data from the API
- **Data Processing Time**: Time to process and transform data
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of data requests served from cache
- **Cache Miss Penalty**: Additional time required for cache misses
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption during data loading and processing

### 3. Interaction Performance Metrics

- **Time to Interactive**: Time until the calendar is fully interactive
- **Input Latency**: Delay between user input and visual response
- **Scroll Performance**: Frame rate during scrolling
- **Drag and Drop Performance**: Responsiveness during drag and drop operations
- **Filter and Search Performance**: Response time for filtering and searching

## Testing Approach

### 1. Rendering Performance Testing

Rendering performance tests focus on measuring and optimizing the speed and efficiency of rendering the calendar component:

- Measure initial render time for different calendar views
- Measure re-render time after state changes
- Measure component mount time for individual components
- Measure frame rate during animations and interactions
- Identify and eliminate unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize component memoization and dependency arrays

#### Key Components to Test:

- `VirtualizedWeekView.tsx`: Virtualized week view rendering performance
- `TimeSlot.tsx`: Time slot rendering performance
- `LazyLoad.tsx`: Lazy loading performance
- `Calendar.tsx`: Overall calendar rendering performance

### 2. Data Loading Performance Testing

Data loading performance tests focus on measuring and optimizing the speed and efficiency of loading and processing data:

- Measure data fetch time for different API endpoints
- Measure data processing time for different data transformations
- Measure cache hit rate and miss penalty
- Identify and eliminate redundant API calls
- Optimize data transformation and processing
- Improve caching strategies

#### Key Data Loading Operations to Test:

- Appointment data loading and processing
- Availability data loading and processing
- Client and clinician data loading and processing
- Calendar state initialization and updates

### 3. Interaction Performance Testing

Interaction performance tests focus on measuring and optimizing the responsiveness of the calendar component during user interactions:

- Measure time to interactive for different calendar views
- Measure input latency for different user interactions
- Measure scroll performance for different calendar views
- Measure drag and drop performance for appointment scheduling
- Measure filter and search performance for appointment filtering

#### Key Interactions to Test:

- Navigating between different dates and views
- Creating and rescheduling appointments
- Scrolling through the calendar
- Filtering and searching appointments
- Handling error states and recovery

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Rendering Optimization Strategies

- Use React.memo for components that don't need to re-render often
- Use useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive calculations and event handlers
- Implement virtualization for large lists and grids
- Optimize CSS and styling to reduce layout recalculations
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

### Data Loading Optimization Strategies

- Implement efficient caching with appropriate TTL
- Use pagination and lazy loading for large data sets
- Optimize data transformation and processing
- Implement request batching and deduplication
- Use optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### Interaction Optimization Strategies

- Debounce and throttle event handlers
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement efficient state management
- Optimize event delegation
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive operations
