## Detailed Issue Analysis

### High Severity Issues

#### Issue #1: Editing a single occurrence of a recurring appointment sometimes affects the entire series
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: Immediate
- **Description**: When editing a single occurrence of a recurring appointment, the changes sometimes affect all occurrences in the series, even when "Edit this occurrence only" is selected.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Create a recurring appointment
  2. Edit one occurrence and select "Edit this occurrence only"
  3. Observe that changes are applied to all occurrences
- **Impact**: This could lead to unintended changes to multiple appointments, potentially causing scheduling conflicts and confusion.
- **Recommended Fix**: Investigate the recurrence handling logic to ensure that the "Edit this occurrence only" option correctly creates an exception to the recurrence pattern.

#### Issue #2: Search by date not working consistently
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Searching for appointments by date does not work consistently, particularly for dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Enter a date in MM/DD/YYYY format in the search box
  2. Observe that no results are returned, even when appointments exist on that date
- **Impact**: Users may not be able to find appointments for specific dates, leading to frustration and potential missed appointments.
- **Recommended Fix**: Enhance the search functionality to support multiple date formats and improve date parsing logic.

#### Issue #3: Network error recovery sometimes requires page refresh
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: When a network error occurs during appointment creation or editing, recovery sometimes requires a page refresh, which can result in lost data.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Disable network connection
  2. Attempt to create or edit an appointment
  3. Re-enable network connection
  4. Observe that the system does not automatically recover
- **Impact**: Users may lose data if they don't realize they need to refresh the page, leading to frustration and potential data loss.
- **Recommended Fix**: Implement automatic retry mechanism and better state preservation during network errors.

### Medium Severity Issues

#### Issue #4: Occasional lag when rescheduling to a different month
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: When rescheduling an appointment to a date in a different month, there is occasionally a lag of 2-3 seconds before the UI updates.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Open an existing appointment
  2. Click "Reschedule"
  3. Select a date in a different month
  4. Observe lag before the UI updates
- **Impact**: This causes a suboptimal user experience but does not prevent the user from completing the task.
- **Recommended Fix**: Optimize the date change handling logic and implement better loading indicators.

#### Issue #5: Sync delay of up to 5 minutes for some appointments
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: When syncing with external calendars, there is sometimes a delay of up to 5 minutes before appointments appear in the external calendar.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Connect to an external calendar
  2. Create a new appointment
  3. Check the external calendar immediately
  4. Observe that the appointment does not appear immediately
- **Impact**: This can cause confusion if users check their external calendar immediately after creating an appointment.
- **Recommended Fix**: Implement more frequent sync intervals and add clearer messaging about sync timing.

#### Issue #6: Slow performance when creating appointments with many attendees
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Creating appointments with 10+ attendees is slower than expected, taking up to 5 seconds to complete.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Create a new appointment
  2. Add 10+ attendees
  3. Save the appointment
  4. Observe that the save operation takes 5+ seconds
- **Impact**: This causes a suboptimal user experience for appointments with many attendees.
