# Calendar Component User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) strategy for the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. UAT is the final phase of testing where actual users test the calendar component to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations.

## Objectives

- Validate that the calendar component meets user requirements and expectations
- Identify any usability issues or pain points
- Gather feedback for future improvements
- Ensure the calendar component is ready for production use

## Testing Participants

### User Groups

1. **Clinicians**: Primary users who will use the calendar for appointment scheduling and management
2. **Administrative Staff**: Users who will manage appointments on behalf of clinicians
3. **IT Support Staff**: Users who will provide technical support for the calendar component
4. **Product Managers**: Stakeholders who will evaluate the calendar component against business requirements

### Participant Selection Criteria

- Participants should represent a diverse range of user roles and experience levels
- Participants should include both new and experienced users of the Valorwell Clinician Portal
- Participants should include users with different levels of technical proficiency
- Participants should include users with different device and browser preferences

## Testing Environment

### Test Environment Setup

- Testing will be conducted in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment
- Test data will be representative of real-world data but will not include sensitive patient information
- Testing will be conducted on various devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Required Resources

- Test environment access for all participants
- Test accounts with appropriate permissions
- Test data for appointments, clients, and clinicians
- Testing instructions and scenarios
- Feedback collection forms

## Testing Schedule

  - Prepare test environment
  - Create test accounts and data
  - Develop testing scenarios and instructions
  - Recruit participants

- **Execution Phase**: Week 5, Days 3-5
  - Conduct UAT sessions
  - Collect feedback
  - Document issues

- **Analysis Phase**: Week 6, Days 1-2
  - Analyze feedback and issues
  - Prioritize issues for resolution
  - Develop action plan

- **Resolution Phase**: Week 6, Days 3-5

  - Prepare for production deployment

## Testing Methodology

### Testing Approach

- **Guided Testing**: Participants will follow predefined scenarios to test specific functionality
- **Exploratory Testing**: Participants will explore the calendar component freely to identify issues
- **Task-Based Testing**: Participants will complete common tasks to evaluate usability and efficiency

### Testing Sessions

- Individual testing sessions will be scheduled for each participant
- Sessions will be facilitated by a test coordinator
- Sessions will be recorded (with participant consent) for later analysis
- Participants will be encouraged to think aloud during testing

### Feedback Collection

- Participants will complete a feedback form after each testing session
- Issues will be documented in a standardized format
- Severity and priority will be assigned to each issue
- Feedback will be categorized by feature area and user role

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Calendar Navigation

1. Log in to the Valorwell Clinician Portal
2. Navigate to the Calendar page
3. Switch between day, week, and month views
4. Navigate to different dates using the date picker
5. Navigate to different dates using the navigation buttons
6. Verify that appointments are displayed correctly in each view

### Scenario 2: Appointment Management

1. Create a new appointment
   - Select a date and time
   - Select a client
   - Select an appointment type
   - Add notes
   - Save the appointment
2. View appointment details
3. Edit an existing appointment
   - Change the date and time
   - Change the appointment type
   - Update notes
   - Save changes
4. Cancel an appointment
5. Verify that changes are reflected in the calendar

### Scenario 3: Calendar Filtering and Search

1. Filter appointments by type
2. Filter appointments by status
3. Search for appointments by client name
4. Search for appointments by date range
5. Verify that filtered and search results are displayed correctly

### Scenario 4: Calendar Synchronization

1. Connect to an external calendar (if applicable)
2. Sync appointments with the external calendar
3. Verify that appointments are synced correctly
4. Disconnect from the external calendar
5. Verify that appointments are no longer synced

### Scenario 5: Error Handling and Recovery

1. Attempt to create an appointment with invalid data
2. Attempt to schedule an appointment during unavailable time
3. Simulate network errors during appointment creation
4. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
5. Verify that recovery mechanisms work as expected

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria

- All test scenarios can be completed successfully
- All features work as specified in the requirements
- No critical or high-severity issues are present
- Data is processed and displayed correctly
- Error handling works as expected

### Non-Functional Criteria

- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- User interface is intuitive and user-friendly
- Accessibility standards are met
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility is achieved
- Security requirements are met

## Issue Management

### Issue Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Issues that prevent users from completing essential tasks
- **High**: Issues that significantly impact usability or functionality
- **Medium**: Issues that affect usability but have workarounds
- **Low**: Minor issues that do not significantly impact usability

### Issue Priority Levels

- **Immediate**: Must be fixed before production deployment
- **High**: Should be fixed before production deployment if possible
- **Medium**: Can be fixed in a subsequent release
- **Low**: May be fixed in a future release

### Issue Resolution Process

1. Issues are documented during UAT sessions
2. Issues are reviewed and prioritized by the development team
3. Critical and high-priority issues are addressed immediately
4. Medium and low-priority issues are scheduled for future releases
5. Fixed issues are verified by the testing team
6. Verified fixes are included in the production deployment

## UAT Exit Criteria

UAT will be considered complete when:

- All test scenarios have been executed
- All critical and high-severity issues have been resolved
- All immediate and high-priority issues have been addressed
- Acceptance criteria have been met
- Stakeholders have signed off on the UAT results

## Post-UAT Activities

- Document lessons learned
- Update documentation based on UAT feedback
