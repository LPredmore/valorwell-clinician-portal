# Calendar Component Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. Integration tests focus on testing the interactions between different parts of the application to ensure they work together as expected.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking API requests
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing of user flows

## Test Organization

Integration tests are organized in the following directories:

- `src/tests/integration/dataFlow.test.tsx`: Tests for data flow between components
- `src/tests/integration/userFlow.test.tsx`: Tests for user flows
- `src/tests/integration/api.test.ts`: Tests for API integration

## Testing Approach

### 1. Data Flow Testing

Data flow tests focus on how data moves between different parts of the application:

- Context providers to consumers
- Parent components to child components
- API responses to UI updates
- State changes propagation

#### Key Data Flows to Test:

- Appointment data flow from API to calendar view
- Calendar state changes propagation to child components
- Error state propagation through the component hierarchy
- Cache updates and their effect on UI components

### 2. User Flow Testing

User flow tests focus on common user interactions with the calendar:

- Creating, updating, and deleting appointments
- Navigating between different calendar views
- Filtering and searching appointments
- Handling error states and recovery

#### Key User Flows to Test:

- Creating a new appointment
- Rescheduling an existing appointment
- Canceling an appointment
- Navigating between day, week, and month views
- Filtering appointments by type or status
- Recovering from error states

### 3. API Integration Testing

API integration tests focus on the interaction between the frontend and backend:

- API request formatting
- Response handling
- Error handling
- Retry logic
- Caching

#### Key API Integrations to Test:

- Fetching appointments
- Creating and updating appointments
- Fetching availability
- Syncing with external calendars
- Error handling and recovery

## Test Scenarios

### Data Flow Test Scenarios

1. **Appointment Data Flow**
   - Verify appointment data is correctly fetched from the API
   - Verify appointment data is correctly processed and transformed
   - Verify appointment data is correctly displayed in the calendar

2. **Calendar State Changes**
   - Verify date range changes update the displayed appointments
   - Verify view type changes update the calendar display
   - Verify filter changes update the displayed appointments

3. **Error State Propagation**
   - Verify API errors are correctly propagated to the UI
   - Verify error recovery mechanisms work as expected
   - Verify error boundaries catch and display errors correctly

### User Flow Test Scenarios

1. **Appointment Creation**
   - Verify user can create a new appointment
   - Verify validation prevents invalid appointments
   - Verify newly created appointment appears in the calendar

2. **Appointment Management**
   - Verify user can reschedule an appointment
   - Verify user can cancel an appointment
   - Verify user can view appointment details

3. **Calendar Navigation**
   - Verify user can navigate between different dates
   - Verify user can switch between day, week, and month views
   - Verify user can filter appointments by type or status

### API Integration Test Scenarios

1. **Appointment API**
   - Verify appointment fetch requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify appointment creation requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify appointment update requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify error handling for failed requests

2. **Availability API**
   - Verify availability fetch requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify availability update requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify error handling for failed requests

3. **External Calendar Sync API**
   - Verify sync requests are correctly formatted
   - Verify sync responses are correctly processed
   - Verify error handling for failed sync requests

## Mocking Strategy

- Backend API will be mocked using Mock Service Worker
- External dependencies will be mocked using Jest mock functions
- User interactions will be simulated using React Testing Library and Cypress

## Test Data

- Test data will be stored in `__fixtures__` directories
- Mock data will be generated using factory functions
- Edge cases will be explicitly defined

## Continuous Integration

- Tests will run on every pull request
- Tests will run on every push to the main branch
- Test failures will be addressed promptly

## Implementation Timeline

1. Set up integration testing infrastructure (Week 5, Day 3)
2. Implement data flow tests (Week 5, Days 3-4)
3. Implement user flow tests (Week 5, Day 5 - Week 6, Day 1)
4. Implement API integration tests (Week 6, Days 1-2)
5. Review and improve test coverage (Week 6, Days 3-4)
