# Calendar Component Issue Triage Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for triaging issues related to the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. The triage process ensures that issues are properly evaluated, categorized, and prioritized for resolution.

## Triage Team

The triage team consists of the following roles:

- **Product Manager**: Responsible for business impact assessment and priority decisions
- **Technical Lead**: Responsible for technical assessment and effort estimation
- **QA Lead**: Responsible for verification and reproduction of issues
- **UX Designer**: Consulted for usability and design-related issues
- **Support Representative**: Provides context from user reports and feedback

## Triage Schedule

- **Daily Triage**: Critical and high severity issues (15-30 minutes)
- **Weekly Triage**: All new issues and status updates (1-2 hours)
- **Bi-Weekly Backlog Review**: Review of medium and low priority backlog (1 hour)

## Triage Process Flow

### Step 1: Issue Intake

#### Sources of Issues
- User-reported issues via support tickets
- QA-identified issues during testing
- Developer-identified issues during development
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- User feedback and feature requests

#### Initial Documentation Requirements
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (browser, device, OS)
- Screenshots or videos (if applicable)
- User impact description
- Initial severity assessment

### Step 2: Initial Screening

#### Verification and Reproduction
1. QA Lead attempts to reproduce the issue
2. Confirms the steps to reproduce
3. Documents any additional context or conditions
4. Captures more detailed evidence if needed

#### Duplicate Check
1. Search for similar or duplicate issues
2. If duplicate found, link issues and update the original
3. If not duplicate, proceed with triage

#### Quick Wins Identification
1. Identify issues that can be resolved immediately
2. Flag for immediate assignment if:
   - Fix is obvious and simple
   - Impact is significant
   - Resources are available

### Step 3: Categorization

#### Issue Type
- **Bug**: Functionality not working as designed
- **Performance Issue**: System running slower than expected
- **UI/UX Issue**: Interface problems or usability concerns
- **Feature Request**: Request for new functionality
- **Technical Debt**: Code quality or architecture issues
- **Documentation**: Documentation errors or omissions

#### Component Assignment
- Calendar Core
- Appointment Management
- Calendar Views (Day, Week, Month)
- Filtering and Search
- External Calendar Integration
- Error Handling
- Performance Optimization
- Accessibility
- Mobile Compatibility

#### Environment Specificity
- All environments
- Production only
- Staging only
- Development only
- Specific browser/device combinations

### Step 4: Impact Assessment

#### User Impact Evaluation
- How many users are affected?
- Which user roles are affected?
- Is there a workaround available?
- How severely does it impact the user workflow?

#### Business Impact Evaluation
- Does it affect revenue or business operations?
- Are there compliance or security implications?
- Does it impact strategic objectives?
- Are there reputational risks?

#### Technical Impact Evaluation
- Does it affect system stability?
- Are there data integrity concerns?
- Does it block other functionality?
- Are there performance implications?

### Step 5: Severity Assignment

Based on the impact assessment, assign a severity level according to the criteria in the Issue Prioritization Framework:

- **Critical**: Complete loss of functionality, security vulnerability, or data integrity issue
- **High**: Significant impact on core functionality with no reasonable workaround
- **Medium**: Partial loss of functionality with acceptable workarounds
- **Low**: Minor issues that don't significantly impact functionality

### Step 6: Effort Estimation

#### Technical Assessment
1. Technical Lead reviews the issue
2. Identifies potential root causes
3. Estimates complexity of the fix
4. Identifies dependencies or blockers

#### Effort Categories
- **Small**: 1-2 days of work
- **Medium**: 3-5 days of work
- **Large**: 1-2 weeks of work
- **Extra Large**: More than 2 weeks of work

#### Confidence Level
- **High**: Clear understanding of the issue and solution
- **Medium**: General understanding but some unknowns
- **Low**: Significant unknowns or complexity

### Step 7: Priority Assignment

Using the Issue Prioritization Framework, assign a priority level based on severity, impact, and effort:

- **P1 (Immediate)**: Must be fixed immediately
- **P2 (High)**: Should be fixed in the current sprint
- **P3 (Medium)**: Should be scheduled for an upcoming sprint
- **P4 (Low)**: Nice to have, but not time-sensitive

### Step 8: Assignment and Scheduling

#### For P1 (Immediate) Issues
- Assign immediately to available developer
- May require pulling resources from other tasks
- Schedule for immediate resolution

#### For P2 (High) Issues
- Assign to the current sprint if capacity allows
- Otherwise, schedule for the next sprint
- Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

#### For P3 (Medium) Issues
- Schedule for upcoming sprints based on capacity
- Group related issues when possible for efficiency
- Consider technical dependencies in scheduling

#### For P4 (Low) Issues
- Add to the backlog
- Review periodically for potential reprioritization
- Consider for inclusion in future sprints if related to other work

### Step 9: Communication

#### Internal Communication
- Update issue tracking system with all details
- Notify relevant team members of critical issues
- Include triage decisions in sprint planning discussions
- Document any decisions or trade-offs made

#### External Communication
- Provide status updates to affected users
- Communicate expected resolution timeframes
- Document workarounds if available
- Update support knowledge base if needed

## Triage Meeting Structure

### Daily Triage (15-30 minutes)
1. Review new critical and high severity issues (5 minutes)
2. Status update on in-progress critical issues (5 minutes)
3. Assignment and scheduling decisions (5-10 minutes)
4. Action items and follow-ups (5 minutes)

### Weekly Triage (1-2 hours)
1. Review of new issues since last meeting (15-30 minutes)
2. Status update on in-progress issues (15 minutes)
3. Reprioritization of existing issues if needed (15 minutes)
4. Assignment and scheduling decisions (15-30 minutes)
5. Discussion of patterns or trends (10 minutes)
6. Action items and follow-ups (10 minutes)

### Bi-Weekly Backlog Review (1 hour)
1. Review of medium and low priority backlog (20 minutes)
2. Reprioritization based on new information (15 minutes)
3. Identification of related issues for batch processing (15 minutes)
4. Action items and follow-ups (10 minutes)

## Special Circumstances

### Hotfix Process
For critical issues that require immediate attention outside of the regular release cycle:

1. Triage team convenes emergency meeting
2. Expedited assessment and prioritization
3. Dedicated resources assigned
4. Abbreviated testing cycle
5. Emergency deployment process initiated

### Major Incident Response
For severe production issues affecting multiple users:

1. Incident response team activated
2. Regular status updates to stakeholders
3. Post-incident review scheduled
4. Root cause analysis documented
5. Preventive measures identified

## Documentation and Tracking

### Required Documentation
- Issue details and reproduction steps
- Severity and priority assignments with rationale
- Effort estimation and confidence level
- Assignment and scheduling decisions
- Dependencies and blockers
- Communication plan

### Tracking Metrics
- Time from issue reporting to triage completion
- Accuracy of effort estimates
- Priority changes over time
- Resolution time by priority level
- Recurring issue patterns

## Continuous Improvement

The triage process should be reviewed and refined regularly based on:

- Team feedback on process efficiency
- Analysis of issue resolution metrics
- Changes in team structure or project priorities
- Lessons learned from challenging issues

Updates to the process should be documented and communicated to all team members.
