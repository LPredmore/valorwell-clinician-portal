# Calendar Component Issue Prioritization Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the framework for prioritizing issues related to the calendar component of the Valorwell Clinician Portal. The framework provides a structured approach to evaluate and prioritize issues based on their impact, urgency, and effort required to resolve them.

## Issue Classification

### Severity Levels

Issues are classified into four severity levels based on their impact on functionality, user experience, and business operations:

#### Critical
- **Definition**: Issues that completely prevent core functionality from working or pose security/data integrity risks
- **Examples**:
  - Calendar fails to load or display
  - Appointments cannot be created or modified
  - Data loss or corruption
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Compliance violations
- **Impact**: Renders the system unusable or compromises data integrity/security

#### High
- **Definition**: Issues that significantly impact core functionality or user experience but have workarounds
- **Examples**:
  - Incorrect appointment times displayed
  - Synchronization failures with external calendars
  - Major UI/UX issues affecting workflow
  - Performance issues causing significant delays
  - Accessibility barriers for key user groups
- **Impact**: Severely hampers productivity or creates significant user frustration

#### Medium
- **Definition**: Issues that affect non-critical functionality or cause minor inconvenience
- **Examples**:
  - Minor UI inconsistencies
  - Non-critical features not working as expected
  - Performance issues with acceptable workarounds
  - Usability issues with reasonable alternatives
- **Impact**: Causes inefficiency or minor frustration but doesn't prevent task completion

#### Low
- **Definition**: Cosmetic issues or minor enhancements that don't affect functionality
- **Examples**:
  - Visual styling inconsistencies
  - Feature enhancement requests
  - Documentation improvements
  - Code refactoring opportunities
- **Impact**: Minimal impact on user experience or system functionality

### Priority Levels

Issues are assigned one of four priority levels based on their urgency and business impact:

#### Immediate (P1)
- **Definition**: Must be fixed immediately, potentially requiring a hotfix
- **Timeframe**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Typically applies to**: Critical severity issues affecting production

#### High (P2)
- **Definition**: Should be fixed in the current sprint or release cycle
- **Timeframe**: Within 1-2 weeks
- **Typically applies to**: High severity issues or critical issues in pre-production

#### Medium (P3)
- **Definition**: Should be scheduled for an upcoming sprint or release
- **Timeframe**: Within 1-2 months
- **Typically applies to**: Medium severity issues or high severity issues with acceptable workarounds

#### Low (P4)
- **Definition**: Nice to have, but not time-sensitive
- **Timeframe**: No specific timeline, addressed when resources permit
- **Typically applies to**: Low severity issues or enhancement requests

## Prioritization Matrix

The following matrix provides guidance on assigning priority levels based on severity and other factors:

| Severity | User Impact | Business Impact | Effort | Typical Priority |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| Critical | High        | High            | Any    | P1 (Immediate)   |

| High     | Low         | Low             | Any    | P3 (Medium)      |
| Medium   | High        | High            | Low    | P2 (High)        |
| Medium   | High        | Medium          | Any    | P3 (Medium)      |
| Medium   | Medium      | Medium          | Any    | P3 (Medium)      |
| Medium   | Low         | Low             | Any    | P4 (Low)         |
| Low      | High        | High            | Low    | P3 (Medium)      |
| Low      | Medium      | Medium          | Any    | P4 (Low)         |
| Low      | Low         | Low             | Any    | P4 (Low)         |

## Prioritization Factors

When determining the priority of an issue, consider the following factors:

### User Impact
- **High**: Affects a large percentage of users (>50%) or critical user personas
- **Medium**: Affects a moderate percentage of users (10-50%) or important user personas
- **Low**: Affects a small percentage of users (<10%) or non-critical user personas

### Business Impact
- **High**: Directly impacts revenue, compliance, or strategic objectives
- **Medium**: Indirectly impacts business operations or reputation
- **Low**: Minimal impact on business operations or objectives

### Effort to Fix
- **Low**: Simple fix requiring minimal resources (1-2 days)
- **Medium**: Moderate complexity requiring reasonable resources (3-5 days)
- **High**: Complex fix requiring significant resources (>1 week)

### Other Considerations
- **Dependencies**: Does this issue block other work or features?
- **Workarounds**: Are there acceptable workarounds available?
- **Frequency**: How often does the issue occur?
- **Trend**: Is the issue becoming more frequent or severe?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Does fixing the issue align with strategic objectives?

## Prioritization Process

### Step 1: Issue Identification and Documentation
1. Document the issue with clear steps to reproduce
2. Capture relevant context (browser, device, user role, etc.)
3. Include screenshots or videos if applicable
4. Assign a unique identifier to the issue

### Step 2: Initial Assessment
1. Determine the severity level based on impact
2. Assess user and business impact
3. Estimate effort required to fix
4. Identify any dependencies or blockers

### Step 3: Priority Assignment
1. Use the prioritization matrix as a guide
2. Consider additional factors and context
3. Assign a priority level (P1-P4)
4. Document the rationale for the priority assignment

### Step 4: Review and Approval
1. Review priority assignments with stakeholders
2. Adjust priorities based on feedback if necessary
3. Obtain approval for the final priority list
4. Communicate priorities to the development team

### Step 5: Monitoring and Adjustment
1. Regularly review issue priorities
2. Adjust priorities based on new information or changing circumstances
3. Escalate issues if impact or urgency increases
4. De-prioritize issues if impact or urgency decreases

## Issue Tracking Workflow

### New Issues
1. New issues are documented and assigned an initial severity and priority
2. Issues are reviewed by the triage team within 24-48 hours
3. Critical issues are escalated immediately to the development team

### In Progress Issues
1. Issues are assigned to developers based on priority
2. Highest priority issues are addressed first
3. Progress is tracked and communicated to stakeholders

### Resolved Issues
1. Resolved issues are verified by QA
2. Resolution is communicated to stakeholders
3. Issues are closed once verified

### Deferred Issues
1. Low priority issues may be deferred to future releases
2. Deferred issues are reviewed periodically
3. Deferred issues may be reprioritized based on changing circumstances

## Escalation Process

### When to Escalate
- Critical issues that cannot be resolved within the expected timeframe
- Issues where priority is disputed
- Issues that have broader implications than initially assessed

### Escalation Path
1. Development Team Lead
2. Product Manager
3. Engineering Manager
4. CTO/VP of Engineering

### Escalation Information
- Issue details and current status
- Impact assessment
- Attempted solutions
- Blockers or challenges
- Recommended next steps

## Reporting and Metrics

### Key Metrics
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve issues by priority
- **Issue Backlog**: Number of open issues by priority
- **Issue Trends**: Patterns in issue types or root causes
- **Priority Distribution**: Distribution of issues across priority levels
- **Priority Accuracy**: How often priorities need to be adjusted

### Reporting Cadence
- Daily report for P1 (Immediate) issues
- Weekly report for P2 (High) issues
- Bi-weekly report for P3 (Medium) issues
- Monthly report for P4 (Low) issues
- Quarterly trend analysis for all issues

## Continuous Improvement

The issue prioritization framework should be reviewed and refined regularly based on:

- Feedback from stakeholders
- Analysis of issue resolution metrics
- Changes in business priorities or user needs
- Lessons learned from past prioritization decisions

Updates to the framework should be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.
